# Copepod

Real-time video-to-video style transformation using SANA-Streaming with FastAPI WebSockets.

## Architecture

```
[Client Webcam] → [Canvas Capture] → [WebSocket] → [SANA-Streaming Pipeline] → [Processed Output]
```

## Setup

### Backend
The backend wraps the Sana repo, which is **not** tracked in this repository —
clone it into `backend/Sana-main` first (or set the `SANA_ROOT` env var to its
location):

```bash
cd backend
git clone <sana-repo-url> Sana-main   # if not already present

# Install the Sana environment (Python 3.11 + CUDA; installs torch 2.9,
# flash-linear-attention, flash-attn, etc.). See Sana-main/environment_setup.sh.
cd Sana-main
bash environment_setup.sh sana   # creates/uses a conda env named "sana"
cd ..

# Then install the server-only deps and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

Note: install Sana's dependencies *before* `requirements.txt`, and don't pin
torch/diffusers/transformers yourself — versions must match
`Sana-main/pyproject.toml`.

### Reducing GPU load / power draw

If the machine crashes or reboots when processing starts (a classic symptom of
transient power spikes, e.g. on an RTX 5090), the backend exposes env-var
knobs to lighten the per-frame and sustained load:

```bash
# 480p instead of 720p: ~2x less DiT/VAE work per chunk
FRAME_WIDTH=832 FRAME_HEIGHT=480 python server.py

# Half the denoising steps (2 instead of 4)
DENOISE_STEPS=2 python server.py

# Process every other input frame (halves sustained processing framerate)
FRAME_SKIP=2 python server.py
```

`FRAME_WIDTH`/`FRAME_HEIGHT` must both be divisible by 32. The knobs combine
freely. The most direct fix for power-spike crashes, though, is capping the
card's power limit, e.g. `nvidia-smi -pl 400` — often sufficient on its own.

To confirm which stage over-stresses the machine, run
`python diagnose_gpu.py` and watch `nvidia-smi` power draw in parallel.

### Frontend
Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser, or serve it:
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080
```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server
2. Open the frontend in a browser
3. Click "Start Stream" to begin webcam capture
4. Enter a processing prompt and click "Apply Prompt"
5. Watch the real-time processed output

## Features

- Real-time video processing with sub-100ms latency
- Configurable processing prompts
- State caching for streaming consistency
- FPS monitoring
- Backpressure handling to prevent frame flooding
- Default prompt: "Replace all corporate logos, and all still or video advertising, with black squares"

## Model

Uses the SANA-Streaming 2B model from [Efficient-Large-Model/SANA-Streaming](https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/SANA-Streaming) with:
- 4 denoising steps for real-time performance
- Chunk-wise generation with state caching
- Sink-token caching for long-range consistency

## Production Optimizations

- Use TensorRT compilation for faster inference
- Enable xFormers/FlashAttention for memory efficiency
- Consider model quantization for lower VRAM usage
- Use persistent model loading to avoid reload overhead
